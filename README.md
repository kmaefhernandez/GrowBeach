# GroBeach DEVELOPER GUIDE

## What Is The Project?

GroBeach is an productivity application with a focus on mental health. We drew inspiration from applications such as Forest as well as Habit Tracker to create what is known as GroBeach. The application will start off with a dirty beach and ocean area. From there on it is your choice to add on habits that you want to track so that you can clean it up. As you continue to check off or record the habits you add to the list that you want to track, your beach gets cleaner as well as and you may get the option to add on cute and unique fish. 

## What Are The Features?

- *Add your habits to a list*
  - *Update and keep track of those habits*
- *Clean and grow your own beach filled with different fish as you check off your habits more often*
